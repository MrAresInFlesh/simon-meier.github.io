Unity program that makes possible to build an ecosystem using procedural map generation technics and simulation centered on the competition between several actors for obtaining resources.

The user has the possibility to modify the parameters of generation of the populations, the number of individuals and their characteristics.

Graphs are generated with the simulation data and shown in the UI.

In this project, I created and developped:

○ `<`Procedural map and ecosystem generation`>`

○ `<`UI components & design`>`

○ `<`Day and night cycle`>`

○ `<`Main loop of the app`>`
